# The Lar Bible

A collection of practical principles for junior backend engineers navigating their first year in software development.

## 1. Master each piece of work you submit

Be able to answer questions about it.

Be able to ask questions about it.

Be able to demo it.

**Know when to ask for help:** If I've been stuck googling or Claude-ing for 30+ minutes, stop. Ask a real person. The answer won't magically appear on page 10 of the Google search results.

**Focus on outcomes:** Say it with me - *"If I cannot clearly articulate the outcome of a ticket in my own words, either the ticket is poorly defined or I have a knowledge gap that needs filling."*

**Key mental checklist:**

- What is actually being asked of me?
- What is the desired outcome?
- What is the bare minimum needed?

## 2. Prioritise blocking vs non-blocking questions

**Blocking questions:** Stop progress until answered. Get them resolved quickly - ask a senior or your friendly neighbourhood LLM.

**Non-blocking questions:** Record them. Don't dive down rabbit holes on opinion-heavy topics like timeouts, config values, or minor over-engineering choices. It's totally fine to revisit these later when you're waiting on your PR review!

**Tip:** Take the time to phrase your questions clearly. If understanding question #4 requires knowing #1–3 first, ask those first. For excellent advice on asking clear, intentional, and well-targeted questions, I strongly recommend reading [this blog post](https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/).

## 3. No context switching

One thing at a time. Do not multitask or switch context mid-ticket.

After submitting a PR, there might be a little voice inside your head that says: *"I'm going to be a great, proactive engineer by picking up a new issue right away!"*

**It is very important that you do not listen to this voice.** Instead, use the time to:

- Answer your non-blocking questions and make adjustments where needed.
- Review and master what you just implemented - questions will emerge during the PR review process and you need to be ready to answer them.
- Learn to say **"I'll do it in a follow-up PR"** to avoid scope creep and perfectionism.

## 4. Notes on learning

**You cannot learn effectively while you are stressed.**

If your stress levels are high, don't try to force new learning - focus on revision instead. Going over things you've already learned will help reinforce existing knowledge, and the familiarity and security of realising what you already know can be therapeutic and reassuring.

If, like me, you get stressed about the pressure of having to learn in the first place, intentionally put it into perspective. Remind yourself that stress doesn't help you learn. Such affirmations have helped to deliberately ease my mind and have opened up mental capacity for real learning to happen.

**Catch stress early.** Stress can be insidious in the way it gradually builds. Check in with yourself on a regular basis, and if you can feel tension building, perhaps it's time to take a walk or get a sweet treat (or both!)

**Learn between tasks when relaxed** - e.g., waiting on PR reviews, or between meetings where you may not have enough time to do actual work.

**Remember:** just doing the work is itself a learning opportunity. Repetition builds intuition. Patterns will emerge over time. The endorphins from actually completing the work will fuel your momentum.

## 5. Accept imperfection in your PRs

Perfectionism is a productivity killer. Waiting until everything is "just right" doesn't make your work better - it just delays progress. A pull request doesn't need to be flawless to be valuable; *it only needs to move the work forward.*

**Submitting an imperfect PR gives you:**

- **Early feedback:** Seniors can catch issues faster than you can obsess over them alone.
- **Momentum:** Progress inspires confidence, even if small adjustments are needed later.
- **Learning opportunities:** You see how your assumptions hold up in the real codebase. If you end up being correct, you get the affirmation that your intuition was correct. If not, you get a free lesson. It's a win-win.

Use the **"I'll do this in a follow-up PR"** liberally. It's not a cop-out, it's a tool to prevent scope creep, reduce stress, and focus on the core outcome. *Done is better than perfect*, and work is far more manageable in smaller chunks - for you and the person reviewing your code.

## 6. Bad habits to leave behind

**Don't worry about perception when asking questions** - as long as you're asking a good one, there is no need to preface it with "Sorry if this is a dumb question" or "I'm a beginner" - Just ask.

If you really think about it, the person you're asking probably just wants you to cut to the chase, and your dramatic preface is wasting your time and theirs - it adds no real value to your question so just ask!

**Sleep on it.** I used to chase the satisfaction of *"finishing the PR"* deep into the evening, especially when I thought I had momentum to snowball, only to look at my work the next day and realise I'd rushed the work in favour of getting the PR up for review. Returning to a PR after a good night's sleep will surface mistakes, simplify decisions, and make the work feel obvious in a way it never does at midnight.

On the subject of sleep, I am most certainly a night owl, but I have come to learn that starting work late and staying up late is a vicious cycle that will do you few favours in corporate tech. Here is what it ends up looking like:

1. You wake up late
2. You start work late as a result
3. You get stuck outside of business hours trying to self-service blocking questions a senior could have helped you with during business hours
4. You stay up late to catch up on the work
5. Because you stayed up late to finish the work, you didn't give yourself time to unwind after work
6. Your sleep is impacted because you didn't have a chance to unwind
7. Repeat

## Summary

**In short:** know your own work, ask the important questions early, do one thing at a time, learn while relaxed, submit imperfect PRs, and get your 8 hours.

The rest will follow.
